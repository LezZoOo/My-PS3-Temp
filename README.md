# My-PS3-Temp
A Tool to manage the PS3 fan speed.

A simple UI, with just the essentials functions to increase and decrease the Fan Speed.
There are also strings to read the actual Temperatures.
I also have included a system to alert you if the temperatures are too high. There are 2 warning message: the first will appear when the temperatures reach 72°, and the second at 75°.

The tool requires webMAN MOD installed on your PS3. It uses PS3Mapi to connect itself to the PS3.
You will need Visual Studio with .NET functions installed to open and compile the Tool.
